# How to contribute

## Pull Requests

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the php-login repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#pull-requests) from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

# How (NOT) to contribute

1. Ladies & Gentlemen, please CHECK YOUR CODE before committing! Some people commit stuff that breaks
the project completely, and obviously they never even tried to run their own code. It takes a long time to check
and as this project provides security-critical stuff it might be fatal if we introduce security holes here.
2. Please only commit useful changes. Some commits destroyed the project or moved it two steps backwards.
3. Please ALWAYS commit into develop branch.
4. Please comment everything you do, everything you change! Comment the parameters, their contents and write
valid PHPdocumentor blocks! If your code does not cleary say what it does, then it's not possible to accept it.

Thanks a lot for all your work!
